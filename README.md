Analyze banking and election data with Python scripts

## Background

Python was used to analysis data for 2 projects: PyBank (financial data) and PyPoll (election results). The output of the script created an analysis summary table for each and a text file output.

### Approach

PyBank:
- Leveraged Python scrips to loop through 86 months profit/loss data
- "For Loops‚Äù where employed to iterate through the data and perform various calculations
- Conditional arguments were used to determine:
    * the largest monthly increase in profit with corresponding date
    * the largest monthly decrease in profit with corresponding date

PyPoll:
- Leveraged Python scrips to loop through 360,000 ballots to determine the following: 
    * Total Ballots Cast
    * Unique Candidates Receiving Votes
    * Candidate Name with Percent of Votes and Total Votes Received
    * Overall Winning Candidate
